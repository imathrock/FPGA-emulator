# FPGA-emulator
A basic FPGA emulator for me to understand how FPGA's work and are programmed. I'm too broke to be able to afford one so ill just make a software version of the simplest FPGA. I will use Logisim to make configurable logic blocs and simulate in software. Maybe also a verilog to circuit programmer. Will use AI limitedly.
